## Project description
The main focus in this project is to implement a costum made code for reggression and classification tasks using a Feed Forward Neural Network. It consists of two main parts, where the first part builds on project 1 fitting of the Runge function, while the second part explores the infamous MNIST classification problem. 

## Structure
The Reg file in the code folder contains the code and figures related to the fitting of the Runge function.
The Classification in the code folder contains the code and figures related to the MNIST classification problem.
All figures are not located in the files as they are but can be reproduced by changing the parameters.  

How to run the code:
1. Set up a python virtual environment

2. Install packages:

3. pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run .ipynb files described above.
