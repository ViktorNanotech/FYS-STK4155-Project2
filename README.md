## Project description
The main focus in this project is to implement a costum made python code for reggression and classification tasks with a Feed Forward Neural Network. It consists of two main parts, where the first part builds on project 1 fitting of the Runge function, while the second part explores the infamous MNIST classification problem. 

## Structure

How to run the code:
1. Set up a python virtual environment

2. Install packages:

3. pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run .ipynb files described above.
